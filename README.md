# nft-project

## Overview

This is a project I made to mint my own NFT collection and to show it off, I made a complementary Web3/React dApp to interact with the NFTs by connecting your MetaMask wallet. I made a smart contract in Solidity to programmatically generate three word NFTs and deployed it on the Rinkeby testnet.

These NFTs can be viewed on OpenSea (but on the Rinkeby Testnet because I am broke... and also don't want to waste money if things break!!!)

## Important

In order to properly use the web app, you need to install MetaMask otherwise it will throw an error.
Additionally, MetaMask must be set on the Rinkeby network as well.
